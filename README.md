¹ RLDX-1 weights are under the **RLWRLD Model License v1.0 (non-commercial)**; "simulation benchmarking" is an explicit intended use. AWS-internal enablement / benchmarking only — not for customer-facing commercial positioning. Weights are downloaded from Hugging Face at runtime (not vendored).

² `rldx-simpler` is the same RLDX-1 model on SimplerEnv (Google Fractal real-robot embodiment, `OXE_FRACTAL`) instead of LIBERO — the one target here that exercises a real-robot OXE embodiment rather than a simulated Panda/humanoid. Setup clones SimplerEnv + ManiSkill2_real2sim at runtime (MIT). End-to-end validated 2026-06-24 (`g6.2xlarge` L4, full `deploy.py` 1-shot smoke); checkpoint pinned at `@f59c79e1`. See the [showcase](#rldx-simpler--rldx-1-rlwrld-on-simplerenv-google-fractal-real-robot-embodiment) and [Expected Results](#expected-results).

³ `rldx-gr1` is the same RLDX-1 model family on **RoboCasa GR-1 Tabletop** (RLWRLD's own `RLDX-1-FT-GR1` checkpoint) — the only target here on a **bimanual humanoid with a waist DOF** (GR-1, `GR1ArmsAndWaistFourierHands`), distinct from all single-arm LIBERO/SimplerEnv clips. Renders via MuJoCo/robosuite (no Vulkan); the RoboCasa GR-1 tabletop-tasks suite is cloned at runtime (MIT). End-to-end validated 2026-06-25 (`g5.2xlarge` A10G 24GB, full `deploy.py` 1-shot smoke); checkpoint pinned at `@d0277c5c`. As source-verified, GR-1 needed **no SimplerEnv-style code patch** (dispatch + obs/action routing already correct at the pin) — only the shared dependency-pin fixes. Measured 0.80 (PnPCupToDrawerClose) and 0.20 (PnPMilkToMicrowaveClose) at n=5; reported paper SR = 58.7% (24-task average). See [Expected Results](#expected-results).

⁴ `rldx-kitchen` is the same RLDX-1 model family on the **RoboCasa Kitchen** 24-task benchmark (RLWRLD's own `RLDX-1-FT-ROBOCASA` checkpoint) — a **single-arm mobile manipulator** (`PandaOmron`: a Franka Panda arm on an Omron LD mobile base) doing pick-and-place, doors, drawers and appliances across full kitchen scenes, distinct from the GR-1 humanoid and the LIBERO/SimplerEnv clips. Renders via MuJoCo/robosuite (no Vulkan); the RoboCasa kitchen suite (`squarefk/robocasa`, MIT) is cloned at runtime and its ~5 GB of scene assets download during setup. Source-verified clean like GR-1 (no dispatch/obs/action patch) with **three RoboCasa-Kitchen-specific fixes** found by reading source: (a) the cloned `download_kitchen_assets.py` has no `-y` argparse and prompts via `input()` → made non-interactive so it runs headless; (b) a dependency-pin reconciliation (the kitchen fork pins `numpy 1.23.3`/`numba 0.56.4`, but the import-reachable `albumentations` needs `numpy>=1.24.4`, so the GR-1-proven `numpy 1.26.4`/`numba 0.61.2` stack is protected); (c) the env emits each of the 3 cameras at two resolutions (256 + 512) and the video recorder stacks all of them into a six-panel strip — narrowed to the 256-px policy views so the saved video is a clean three-panel clip (cosmetic; obs/policy/SR untouched). Checkpoint pinned at `@e8279a38`. End-to-end validated 2026-06-26 (`g6.2xlarge` L4 24 GB, full `deploy.py` 1-shot smoke); fixes (a)+(b) confirmed live (the ~5 GB asset download ran headless and the `numpy`/`numba`/`albumentations` stack resolved); fix (c) observed in the Gate-3 output and applied to the committed clips (re-validates live on next deploy). Two articulated tasks at n=5: `OpenSingleDoor` `success_rate = 0.80` (4/5) and `OpenDrawer` `success_rate = 0.80` (4/5); reported paper SR = 70.6% (24-task average). See [Expected Results](#expected-results).

⁵ `molmoact2` is **Apache-2.0** (weights + code, commercial use OK). Unlike the LeRobot-native targets, it is **not on upstream LeRobot** — it is served from the `allenai/lerobot` fork (`molmoact2-policy` branch, pinned `@a4f15bf3`) installed via `uv sync --locked` (Python 3.12), running the public `allenai/MolmoAct2-LIBERO` checkpoint **in-process** on the sim GPU (no separate policy server). The official LIBERO eval recipe is **float32** (`use_amp=false`) + `norm_tag=libero`, continuous action mode — so the ~20 GB fp32 checkpoint forces a ≥40 GB single GPU **and** ≥64 GiB host RAM (`g6e.2xlarge`+ L40S; `g6e.xlarge`'s 32 GiB host RAM thrashes the checkpoint load and is excluded). End-to-end validated 2026-06-28 (`g6e.2xlarge`, us-west-2; full `deploy.py` 1-shot). `libero_goal = 1.000` (2 tasks × 5 episodes); reported paper LIBERO average = 97.2%. See the [showcase](#molmoact2--molmoact2-ai2-on-libero-goal-franka-panda-7-dof) and [Expected Results](#expected-results).

#### `pi` — π0.5 on LIBERO (Franka Panda 7-DOF)

`libero_spatial = 0.99` (10 tasks × 10 episodes), `libero_object = 0.96` (10 tasks × 5 episodes) — `g5.xlarge`, validated 2026-04-22.

#### `openvla-oft` — OpenVLA-OFT on LIBERO-10 long-horizon

Each task is a two-stage instruction. Long-horizon means the policy must complete one sub-goal, recognise it, then proceed to the next. Verb diversity below shows the same checkpoint following structurally different instructions. `g6.xlarge`, validated 2026-05-04. Carries a `mujoco==3.3.1` pin (FIX 14, `sim_protect_pins`) and a `tensorflow-metadata==1.17.3` pin (FIX 15): mujoco 3.10.0 shipped 2026-06-22, after this target validated, and its `mj_fullM` signature change breaks robosuite's call site mid-eval, while an unbounded `tensorflow-metadata` resolves to a release whose code needs a protobuf that `tensorflow==2.15` forbids (see [#4](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-vla-simulator-on-aws/issues/4)).

#### `lap` — LAP-3B on LIBERO-Spatial

`libero_spatial = 0.98` (10 tasks × 5 trials, `g6.xlarge`, validated 2026-05-17). Same scene as `pi` above, different policy — useful for side-by-side comparison. The `cookie_box` task is the one consistent failure mode (paper Table III range 85–95% leaves 1–2 tasks expected to miss).

#### `molmoact2` — MolmoAct2 (Ai2) on LIBERO-Goal (Franka Panda 7-DOF)

MolmoAct2 is Ai2's open **Action Reasoning Model** (5B; a Molmo2-ER VLM backbone + a flow-matching continuous-action expert), **Apache-2.0** weights and code. Unlike the LeRobot-native models above, it is served from the `allenai/lerobot` fork (`molmoact2-policy` branch, not yet merged upstream), pinned at `@a4f15bf3`; the public `allenai/MolmoAct2-LIBERO` checkpoint is run **in-process** on the sim GPU. `libero_goal = 1.000` (2 tasks × 5 episodes = 10/10), `g6e.2xlarge` (L40S 48 GB), **float32** + `norm_tag=libero`, continuous action mode, validated 2026-06-28. Both clips below are the same `put the bowl on the stove` task from different LIBERO initial states (the only task rendered locally this run); the consistent place-on-burner across init states is what 1.000 looks like here.

#### `rldx` — RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) on LIBERO-10 long-horizon (Franka Panda 7-DOF)

RLDX-1 is a Korea-origin SOTA open VLA (MSAT action head on a Qwen3-VL-8B backbone; 97.8% LIBERO average in the paper). Served eager via a ZeroMQ policy server + sim client (two venvs), `g6.xlarge` L4 sm_89, validated 2026-06-20. Two LIBERO-10 **long-horizon** tasks (distinct scenes from the `pi` / `lap` spatial clips above): `STUDY_SCENE1` book→caddy `success_rate = 1.0` (5/5); `KITCHEN_SCENE6` mug→microwave+close (articulated, two-stage) `success_rate = 0.8` (4/5). Weights are **non-commercial** (RLWRLD Model License v1.0) — sim benchmarking only. Carries a `mujoco==3.3.1` pin (FIX 11, `sim_protect_pins`): mujoco 3.10.0 shipped 2026-06-22 — two days after this target validated — and its `mj_fullM` signature change breaks robosuite's call site, so the LIBERO dependency chain must hold mujoco below 3.10 (see [#4](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-vla-simulator-on-aws/issues/4)).

| Success — `STUDY_SCENE1: pick up the book and place it in the back compartment of the caddy` (SR 1.0, 5/5) | Success — `KITCHEN_SCENE6: put the yellow and white mug in the microwave and close it` (SR 0.8, 4/5) |

| _Tight, consistent: all 5 episodes complete in 20–23 env-steps._ | Failure (1/5) — same task, hits the 90-step cap without closing: |

| | MP4: [`rldx/libero10-kitchen-mug-microwave-failure.mp4`](docs/showcase/rldx/libero10-kitchen-mug-microwave-failure.mp4) (clip is 2× speed) |

> **Reading the success rate — "success" is a binary goal flag, not a quality score.** LIBERO marks an episode `success` the moment its BDDL goal predicate is satisfied; it says nothing about how cleanly or how close to the failure boundary the policy got there. That distinction matters on long-horizon tasks:
> - `STUDY_SCENE1` (SR 1.0) is genuinely robust — every episode finishes in 20–23 env-steps with margin to spare.
> - `KITCHEN_SCENE6` (SR 0.8) is **marginal even when it succeeds**: successful episodes range from a clean 32 steps to a labored 47 steps, while the failure runs the full 90-step cap (a *timeout*, not a hard error). The scene also contains a second (grey) mug as a distractor next to the yellow/white target. A near-cap success is one perturbation away from a timeout — so treat 0.8 here as "works, but not yet deployment-margin," not as a 4-in-5 guarantee of reliable execution.
>
> Takeaway for demos: pair the SR number with the **step-count spread** (in `simulation_results.csv`) and watch the failure clip — a high SR with episodes clustered near the step cap is a weaker result than the same SR with short, consistent runs.

#### `rldx-simpler` — RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) on SimplerEnv Google Fractal (real-robot embodiment)

Same RLDX-1 checkpoint family as `rldx` above, but evaluated on **SimplerEnv** (ManiSkill2_real2sim + SAPIEN) with the Google Robot **`OXE_FRACTAL`** embodiment — the one target here that exercises a *real-robot* Open X-Embodiment embodiment rather than a simulated Panda/humanoid. Served eager via the same ZeroMQ policy server + sim client (two venvs), `g6.2xlarge` L4 sm_89, validated 2026-06-24 via a full `deploy.py` 1-shot smoke. Two Google-VM tasks: `google_robot_pick_coke_can` `success_rate = 1.0` (5/5) and `google_robot_move_near` `success_rate = 1.0` (5/5). Weights are **non-commercial** (RLWRLD Model License v1.0) — sim benchmarking only.

> **Clips are shown at 0.25× (slowed 4×)**, with the playback rate overlaid bottom-left. These are *atomic* Google-robot tasks — each episode runs only 10–25 sim steps, so at native speed it finishes in ~1 second. The 4× slowdown makes the motion legible and paces these clips with the long-horizon GR-1 clips below (up to 720 steps). No frames are dropped or trimmed; only the timestamps are stretched.

| _Tight and consistent: episodes complete in 10–25 env-steps (shown at 0.25×)._ | _Real-robot Fractal embodiment — distinct from every LIBERO/RoboCasa clip above (shown at 0.25×)._ |

#### `rldx-gr1` — RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) on RoboCasa GR-1 Tabletop (bimanual humanoid + waist)

Same RLDX-1 family as `rldx`/`rldx-simpler`, but on **RoboCasa GR-1 Tabletop** with RLWRLD's own `RLDX-1-FT-GR1` checkpoint — the only target here on a **bimanual humanoid with a waist DOF** (`GR1ArmsAndWaistFourierHands`: two 7-DOF arms + Fourier dexterous hands + waist), distinct from every single-arm LIBERO/SimplerEnv clip. Each clip is dual-view (left ego / right third-person); the policy controls both hands and the waist to manipulate **articulated** scene objects (a drawer, a microwave door). Served eager via the same ZeroMQ policy server + sim client (two venvs, MuJoCo/robosuite headless EGL — no Vulkan), `g5.2xlarge` A10G 24 GB, validated 2026-06-25 via a full `deploy.py` 1-shot smoke. Two articulated tasks at n=5: `PnPCupToDrawerClose` `success_rate = 0.80` (4/5) and `PnPMilkToMicrowaveClose` `success_rate = 0.20` (1/5) — the combined 5/10 is consistent with the paper's 58.7% 24-task average. Weights are **non-commercial** (RLWRLD Model License v1.0) — sim benchmarking only.

| Success — `PnPCupToDrawerClose` (SR 0.80, 4/5) | Success — `PnPMilkToMicrowaveClose` (SR 0.20, 1/5) |

| _Clean bimanual pick-place-close in 19 env-steps; the harder of the two tasks the policy reliably solves._ | _The rare success on the hard task (24 steps) — most runs time out (see failure clip)._ |

#### `rldx-kitchen` — RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) on RoboCasa Kitchen (PandaOmron mobile manipulator)

Same RLDX-1 family again, but on the **RoboCasa Kitchen** 24-task benchmark with RLWRLD's own `RLDX-1-FT-ROBOCASA` checkpoint — a **single-arm mobile manipulator** (`PandaOmron`: a Franka Panda arm on an Omron LD mobile base) operating **articulated kitchen fixtures** (cabinet doors, drawers) inside full procedurally-generated kitchen scenes, distinct from the GR-1 humanoid and every LIBERO/SimplerEnv clip. Each clip is a three-camera strip — the two external views (left / right) plus the wrist camera, exactly the views the policy consumes. Served eager via the same ZeroMQ policy server + sim client (two venvs, MuJoCo/robosuite headless EGL — no Vulkan), `g6.2xlarge` L4 24 GB, validated 2026-06-26 via a full `deploy.py` 1-shot smoke. Two articulated tasks at n=5: `OpenSingleDoor` `success_rate = 0.80` (4/5) and `OpenDrawer` `success_rate = 0.80` (4/5) — consistent with the paper's 70.6% 24-task average. Weights are **non-commercial** (RLWRLD Model License v1.0) — sim benchmarking only.

> RoboCasa Kitchen's env emits each of the three cameras at two resolutions (a 256-px policy input + a raw 512-px copy), and the stock video recorder stacks **all** of them — so the unfiltered MP4 is a six-panel strip showing every camera twice. A target-gated runtime fix (FIX 10) narrows the recorder to the 256-px views, giving the clean three-panel video below. The clips here are post-processed to that same three-panel form; FIX 10 makes it the default on the next deploy.

#### `gr00t-gr1` — GR00T N1.6 on RoboCasa GR1 humanoid (22-DOF)

The GR1 humanoid is a different embodiment from Franka Panda — two arms, waist, Fourier dexterous hands. `PosttrainPnPNovelFromPlateToBowlSplitA` is in distribution for the post-trained N1.6 (~80% success), while `PnPCanToDrawerClose` is **not supported** by the pre-trained checkpoint and consistently fails — included to make the embodiment-coverage limitation visible. `g6.12xlarge`, validated 2026-04-10.

#### `gr00t-g1` — GR00T N1.6 on Unitree G1 (whole-body loco-manipulation)

This is **whole-body loco-manipulation**, not tabletop: the dual-view clips show the G1 humanoid grasp the apple, then *walk left* on its own legs (GR00T-WholeBodyControl Balance/Walk ONNX policies) to a second table and place it on the plate — task `pick up the apple, walk left and place the apple on the plate` (`LMPnPAppleToPlateDC_G1_gear_wbc`). The left pane is the ego/close view, the right is third-person.

> **Checkpoint note.** NVIDIA published no N1.7 Unitree G1 checkpoint, and the only public N1.6 G1 checkpoint (`nvidia/GR00T-N1.6-G1-PnPAppleToPlate`) does **not** reproduce its stated success rate under the released evaluation command — it scores 0/10, matching multiple open Isaac-GR00T issues with no upstream fix. The only public artifact that reproduces the task is a community re-finetune, [`cloudwalk-research/GR00T-N1.6-G1-PnPAppleToPlate`](https://huggingface.co/cloudwalk-research/GR00T-N1.6-G1-PnPAppleToPlate) (same GR00T N1.6 architecture, drop-in compatible), which scores **`success_rate = 0.3` (3/10)** here. `g6.12xlarge`, `n_envs=1`, validated 2026-06-15.

| Success — apple picked, walked left, placed on plate | Failure — grasp + walk OK, placement misses |

##### Optional: run a fine-tuned GR00T **N1.7** Unitree-G1 adapter on the same sim

The same `gr00t-g1` target can serve a fine-tuned **GR00T N1.7** Unitree-G1 adapter instead of the N1.6 demo checkpoint. NVIDIA published no N1.7 G1 checkpoint (`UNITREE_G1` is a post-train tag — the base gives ~0%), so this is a fine-tuned adapter. The default in [`models/gr00t-g1.yaml`](models/gr00t-g1.yaml) points `server.hf_repo` at a gated published checkpoint, [`andrewc76/GR00T-N1.7-G1-AppleToPlate`](https://huggingface.co/andrewc76/GR00T-N1.7-G1-AppleToPlate) (request access, then grant the deploy's Hugging Face token). To use your own instead, set `server.hf_repo` to your HF repo, or `server.s3_ckpt_uri` to an S3 bucket — collect demos with `--collect` (the N1.6 teacher above), fine-tune a G1 adapter on GR00T N1.7, and point the server at your merged checkpoint.

The interesting part is that the N1.7 server (Isaac-GR00T `65cc4a`, `Gr00tN1d7` / Cosmos-Reason2-2B) and the WBC sim env (Isaac-GR00T `77866395`, the only commit where `GR00T-WholeBodyControl` still exists) **cannot share one venv** — so the deploy runs a **2-venv split** across the ZMQ `:8000` boundary and overlays the N1.7 wire codec (`msgpack_numpy`) onto the sim venv to keep obs/action serialization aligned. This is automatic when the `server:` block is present. See the comments in `models/gr00t-g1.yaml` for the design and the **action-horizon consistency** gotcha (a model/processor horizon mismatch is silent at export but crashes the rollout at step 0).

In our run, a G1 adapter fine-tuned on demos collected from the N1.6 teacher reached `success_rate = 0.7` (7/10) on the same `LMPnPAppleToPlateDC_G1_gear_wbc` task — the N1.7 adapter clips below were produced exactly this way (your numbers will depend on your fine-tune).

| N1.7 success — apple picked, walked left, placed on plate | N1.7 failure — grasp + walk OK, placement misses |

#### `gr00t` — GR00T N1.7 on LIBERO-10 (Franka Panda)

*Video capture pending — KITCHEN_SCENE3/4 success rate is `1.0` on the validated runs (see [Expected Results](#expected-results)), but those rollout videos were not retained locally. Will backfill on the next `--vla gr00t` deploy.*

Carries a `mujoco==3.3.1` pin (FIX 14, `sim_protect_pins`): mujoco 3.10.0 shipped 2026-06-22 — after this target validated 2026-04-27 — and its `mj_fullM` signature change breaks robosuite's call site, so `setup_libero.sh`'s own closing env check fails on a clean deploy without the pin (see [#4](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-vla-simulator-on-aws/issues/4)).

#### `openarm-lift-act` — OpenArm unimanual Lift-Cube (Isaac Lab)

> **Not a learned-policy rollout.** Unlike the entries above (each a trained VLA evaluated in LIBERO/RoboCasa), this target runs a **scripted state machine** (`REST → APPROACH → GRASP → LIFT`) on the OpenArm arm in Isaac Lab to *collect* successful pick-and-lift demonstrations — the camera + state + action HDF5 that an ACT policy is then trained on. The clip shows the data-collection rollout, not an evaluated policy. Training ACT on this dataset and showing a *learned* rollout is the next step.

Rendered at 768×768, captured during a `--vla openarm-lift-act` collection run (`g6.12xlarge`, 4× L4, eu-central-1, 2026-06-11). The third-person (table) view is the beauty shot; the wrist view is the gripper POV.

### Architecture

```
deploy.py
  │
  ├─ generate.py          → assets/userdata/{vla}.sh
  │
  └─ CDK deploy
       ├─ VPC + SG
       ├─ S3 ResultsBucket (RETAIN)
       ├─ SNS + EmailSubscription
       ├─ IAM Role
       ├─ AzSelector Lambda  →  EC2 (g6.12xlarge / g5.xlarge)
       └─ WaitCondition      ←  cfn_signal from UserData
```

**Two deployment modes:**

- **Local mode** — model runs directly on the EC2 instance (default)
- **Bridge mode** — EC2 runs simulation env; model inference forwarded to an existing VLA Hub ECS endpoint

---

## Quick Start

A single CLI (`vlasim.py`) wraps the whole setup into three commands. It runs on
the standard library alone, so `doctor` works on a fresh host **before** any
dependencies are installed.

```bash
# 1. See what's missing (read-only — safe to run anytime)
python vlasim.py doctor

# 2. One-time setup: installs Python + CDK deps and fills simulator-config.yaml
python vlasim.py init --email you@example.com
#   add --bootstrap to also run `cdk bootstrap` for your account/region

# 3. Deploy (runs doctor as a preflight first, then deploy.py)
python vlasim.py deploy --vla gr00t-g1
```

`doctor` checks: Python/Node/CDK versions and installs, AWS credentials, region
support, CDK bootstrap, GPU On-Demand vCPU quota (per target), and `notify_email`.
It exits non-zero if any check **FAILs**, so the `deploy` preflight stops a missing
quota or un-bootstrapped account in seconds rather than mid-deploy (idle GPU billing).

```
$ python vlasim.py doctor --vla gr00t-g1
  [ OK ] Python 3.12.1 (>= 3.10)
  [ OK ] Node v22.22.1
  [ OK ] AWS credentials valid (account ..., region us-east-1)
  [ OK ] CDK bootstrap present in us-east-1
  [ OK ] On-Demand G/VR vCPU quota = 768 in us-east-1 (>= 4 for g6.xlarge ...)
  [FAIL] notify_email is still the placeholder
         -> run: python vlasim.py init --email YOU@EXAMPLE.COM
```

`deploy` and `destroy` forward every flag to `deploy.py` / `destroy.py` unchanged
(`--bridge`, `--collect`, `--libero-suite`, `--region`, …). Use `--skip-doctor` to
bypass the deploy preflight. Run `python vlasim.py deploy --help` for the full list.

Supported regions: `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `ap-northeast-1`, `ap-northeast-2`, `eu-central-1`

> **Manual setup** (equivalent to `init`, if you prefer to run the steps yourself):
> ```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt          # boto3, pyyaml, jinja2
> cd cdk && npm install && cd ..           # CDK deps (aws-cdk is pinned in cdk/package.json)
> aws configure                            # or: export AWS_PROFILE=...
> # then edit deployment.region / notify_email in simulator-config.yaml
> ```

---

## Deploy Targets

Each target is one `vlasim deploy --vla <target>` (which runs the `doctor` preflight,
then forwards every flag to `deploy.py` unchanged). The `--email` is only needed the
first time, or if you skipped `init`.

```bash
# GR00T N1.7 — LIBERO kitchen tasks (~120 min)
python vlasim.py deploy --vla gr00t --email you@example.com

# GR00T N1.6 + GR1 humanoid — RoboCasa tabletop tasks (~90 min)

# GR00T N1.6 + Unitree G1 — whole-body loco-manipulation (GR00T-WholeBodyControl, ~20-30 min)
python vlasim.py deploy --vla gr00t-g1 --email you@example.com

python vlasim.py deploy --vla openvla-oft --libero-suite object --email you@example.com
python vlasim.py deploy --vla openvla-oft --libero-suite goal   --email you@example.com

# LAP-3B — LIBERO-Spatial (zero-shot cross-embodiment VLA, JAX policy server, ~1.5-2.5 hrs)
python vlasim.py deploy --vla lap --email you@example.com

# MolmoAct2 (Ai2) — LIBERO-Goal (Apache-2.0 5B Action Reasoning Model, fp32 in-process, g6e GPU ≥48GB, ~40-60 min)
# Use --region us-west-2 (g6e capacity); us-east-1 currently has no g6e capacity.
python vlasim.py deploy --vla molmoact2 --email you@example.com --region us-west-2

# RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) — LIBERO (SOTA open VLA, MSAT/Qwen3-VL-8B, ZeroMQ server + sim client, ~80-120 min)
# NON-COMMERCIAL weights (sim benchmarking) — AWS-internal enablement only.
python vlasim.py deploy --vla rldx --email you@example.com

# RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) — SimplerEnv Google-VM (real-robot OXE_FRACTAL embodiment, ~35-45 min)
# NON-COMMERCIAL weights (sim benchmarking) — AWS-internal enablement only.
python vlasim.py deploy --vla rldx-simpler --email you@example.com

# RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) — RoboCasa GR-1 Tabletop (bimanual humanoid + waist, MuJoCo, ~25-35 min)
# NON-COMMERCIAL weights (sim benchmarking) — AWS-internal enablement only.
python vlasim.py deploy --vla rldx-gr1 --email you@example.com

# RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) — RoboCasa Kitchen 24-task (PandaOmron mobile manipulator, MuJoCo, ~25-35 min)
# NON-COMMERCIAL weights (sim benchmarking) — AWS-internal enablement only.
python vlasim.py deploy --vla rldx-kitchen --email you@example.com

# OpenArm Lift-Cube — scripted ACT demo collection in Isaac Lab (HDF5 only; needs a 4-GPU instance)
python vlasim.py deploy --vla openarm-lift-act --email you@example.com
```

On first deploy you will receive an SNS subscription confirmation email — **click the link** to enable notifications.

> **Direct invocation.** `vlasim deploy` is a thin wrapper — every command above also
> runs as `python deploy.py --vla <target> ...` with the same flags, skipping the
> `doctor` preflight. Use that if you've already run `doctor` and want to bypass it
> (equivalently, `vlasim deploy --skip-doctor`).

## Results

When simulation finishes you receive an SNS email with download instructions:

```bash
# GR00T results
aws s3 sync s3://vla-sim-results-gr00t-demo-us-east-1-<ACCOUNT>/RUN_ID/ ./results/ --region us-east-1

# π0.5 results
aws s3 sync s3://vla-sim-results-pi-demo-us-east-1-<ACCOUNT>/RUN_ID/ ./results/ --region us-east-1
```

Each `task-N/` folder contains:
- `videos/rollout_<task_name>_success.mp4` — successful episodes
- `videos/rollout_<task_name>_failure.mp4` — failed episodes
- `videos/<name>.txt` — per-video metadata
- `summary.txt` — `success_rate`, `suite`, `num_episodes_per_task`
- `compose.log` / `userdata.log` — execution logs

---

## Cleanup

```bash
python vlasim.py destroy --vla gr00t
python vlasim.py destroy --vla gr00t-gr1
python vlasim.py destroy --vla gr00t-g1
python vlasim.py destroy --vla pi
python vlasim.py destroy --vla openvla-oft                         # default suite (10)
python vlasim.py destroy --vla openvla-oft --libero-suite spatial  # non-default suite
python vlasim.py destroy --vla lap
python vlasim.py destroy --vla rldx
python vlasim.py destroy --vla rldx-simpler
python vlasim.py destroy --vla rldx-gr1
python vlasim.py destroy --vla rldx-kitchen
```

> `vlasim destroy` forwards to `destroy.py` unchanged — `python destroy.py --vla <target>`
> works identically if you prefer to call it directly.

The S3 results bucket is **retained** after stack deletion to preserve simulation outputs.

- RLDX-1 (RLWRLD): libero_10 long-horizon, two tasks (eager, g6.xlarge L4 sm_89) — `STUDY_SCENE1` book→caddy = 1.0 (5/5, tight 20–23 steps), `KITCHEN_SCENE6` mug→microwave+close = 0.8 (4/5; successes span 32–47 steps and the one failure is a 90-step-cap timeout — marginal even when it succeeds, see the showcase caveat). Full `deploy.py` deploy; ZeroMQ policy server + sim client, two-venv (main + `libero_uv`). Default `n_envs=1` (5 recommended on g6.2xlarge+); checkpoint `RLWRLD/RLDX-1-FT-LIBERO@989037c6`, repo `RLWRLD/RLDX-1@ecbfaf80`
- RLDX-1 (RLWRLD) GR-1 Tabletop: two articulated tasks (eager, g5.2xlarge A10G 24GB) — `PnPCupToDrawerClose` = 0.80 (4/5, clean 13–19 steps), `PnPMilkToMicrowaveClose` = 0.20 (1/5; the single success at 24 steps, the four failures all hit the 45-step cap as timeouts). Combined 5/10 ≈ paper 24-task avg 58.7%. The only target on a **bimanual humanoid + waist** (`GR1ArmsAndWaistFourierHands`); MuJoCo/robosuite headless EGL (no Vulkan). Source-verified needed **no SimplerEnv-style code patch** — confirmed live: the `[5/8]` gr1-venv verify (dispatch + obs/action contract + import-time env registration) passed without FIX 4/6/7, and `setup_gr1.sh` exited 0 (committed-as-files submodule → `git submodule update` is a no-op, no FIX 5). Server cold-load fast (~210s). Checkpoint `RLWRLD/RLDX-1-FT-GR1@d0277c5c`, repo `RLWRLD/RLDX-1@ecbfaf80`

## Bridge Mode

Bridge mode connects the simulation environment on EC2 to an external VLA model endpoint (e.g. VLA Hub on ECS), without downloading the model locally.

### GR00T bridge

```bash
# Set endpoint in models/gr00t.yaml (or SSM):
#   bridge.remote_grpc_endpoint: ssm:/vla-hub/gr00t/n1-7/grpc-endpoint
#   bridge.vpc_id: ssm:/vla-hub/vpc-id

python vlasim.py deploy --vla gr00t --bridge
```

### π0.5 bridge

```bash
# Set in models/pi.yaml:
#   bridge.vpc_id: vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
#   bridge.nlb_endpoint: internal-xxx.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:50052

python vlasim.py deploy --vla pi --bridge
```

### LAP-3B bridge

LAP shares π0.5's openpi WebSocket bridge pattern. The instance runs only the LIBERO
sim + a WebSocket↔gRPC bridge (`assets/bridge/lap/`); the LAP-3B JAX model runs on the
remote vla-hub LAP ECS task (port 50055). No local checkpoint download.

```bash
# Set in models/lap.yaml (or use ssm: for nlb_endpoint):
#   bridge.vpc_id: vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                       # the vla-hub VPC
#   bridge.nlb_endpoint: internal-xxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:50055
#                        or ssm:/vla-hub/lap/3b/grpc-endpoint

python vlasim.py deploy --vla lap --bridge
```

> Bridge differs from π0.5 only in the wire contract: LAP uses a nested observation
> (`observation.base_0_rgb` / `left_wrist_0_rgb` / `state`), a 10-dim state
> (eef_pos 3 + eef_rot6d 6 + gripper 1), a `frame_description` field, and a (10,7)
> action chunk — see `assets/bridge/lap/lap.proto`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Embodiment tag 'LIBERO_PANDA' is not supported"

The **base** GR00T N1.7-3B model does not support LIBERO simulation. Use the fine-tuned checkpoint:

```yaml
# models/gr00t.yaml
model:
  hf_repo: nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-LIBERO
  hf_subfolder: libero_10
```

### "No visible GPU devices" (π0.5 task-0)

JAX inside the Docker container fails if GPU passthrough isn't ready before the task loop starts. The `[2.5/5]` step in the UserData script polls `docker run --gpus all nvidia-smi` until GPU is confirmed before proceeding.

### Stack rollback / InsufficientInstanceCapacity

The `AzSelectorConstruct` Lambda automatically retries across AZs and falls back through the instance type preference list (`g6.12xlarge` → `g5.12xlarge` → `g6.xlarge` → `g5.xlarge` for GR00T). No manual intervention needed — CDK rollback means no capacity was found; re-deploying will retry.

### CDK synth cdk.out conflict (parallel deploys)

Use model-specific output directories:

```bash
npx cdk deploy GR00T-Demo --output cdk.out-gr00t -c vla=gr00t -c region=us-east-1 ...
npx cdk deploy Pi-Demo    --output cdk.out-pi    -c vla=pi    -c region=us-east-1 ...
```

`deploy.py` handles this automatically.

### apt lock on DLAMI boot

`unattended-upgrades` holds the apt lock for ~2 minutes on fresh boot. The UserData waits up to 120 seconds then forcibly kills the process. No action needed.

## Cost Estimate (us-east-1, on-demand)

| Instance | Spot/OD | Hourly | GR00T (~2h) | π0.5 (~4h) | LAP (~2.5h) |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| g6.12xlarge | On-Demand | ~$4.09 | ~$8.18 | — | — |
| g5.xlarge   | On-Demand | ~$1.01 | — | ~$4.04 | — |
| g6.xlarge   | On-Demand | ~$0.80 | — | — | ~$2.00 |

Use Spot instances via `deploy.py --spot` (not yet implemented) for 60–70% savings.

The `rldx`/`rldx-simpler`/`rldx-gr1`/`rldx-kitchen` targets are built on **RLDX-1 by [RLWRLD](https://github.com/RLWRLD/RLDX-1)** — gratefully acknowledged. RLDX-1's eval harness vendors LIBERO, SimplerEnv, RoboCasa, and GR-1 task suites as submodules (all MIT); this sample clones the RLDX-1 repo at a pinned commit at runtime and applies small in-place runtime fixes to the clone only — the upstream repo is never modified and no model weights are committed here. Per target: `rldx` needs only the shared dependency-pin fixes; `rldx-simpler` adds a SimplerEnv dispatch + obs/action adapter patch; `rldx-gr1` needs no code patch (dispatch + obs/action routing already correct at the pin); `rldx-kitchen` needs no dispatch/obs/action patch but adds three RoboCasa-Kitchen-specific runtime fixes (making the cloned asset downloader non-interactive for headless setup; a `numpy`/`numba` pin reconciliation so the import-reachable `albumentations` resolves against the kitchen fork; and a cosmetic video-recorder narrowing so the saved clip shows each camera once rather than duplicating it at two resolutions).
